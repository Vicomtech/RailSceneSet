# RailSceneSet

The RailSceneSet dataset contains 68 diverse scenarios of a 3D virtual railway environment. Each scenario contains 200 RGB frames taken from a pinhole camera set at the front of the train, along with the semantic segmentation for each frame. Each scenario is also described by an ASAM OpenLABEL file, which contains information about the context, actions of the train, objects present in the environment and intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters.

# Licensing

The licensing of this dataset is subject to the Unreal Engine End User License Agreement (EULA). Please refer to the Unreal Engine EULA for specific details regarding the usage and distribution of the dataset. The EULA sets the terms and conditions for using Unreal Engine and any content generated using it, including the RailSceneSet dataset.

As a user of this dataset, it is your responsibility to comply with the terms specified in the Unreal Engine EULA. Ensure that you read and understand the EULA before using the dataset for any purpose.

# Attributions

The RailSceneSet dataset was generated employing the CARLA Simulator, on Unreal Engine 4. The dataset was generated as part of the work presented in the paper "Scenario-Based Validation of Automated Train Systems Using a 3D Virtual Railway Environment". The paper is to be published in the 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2023).
